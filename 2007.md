- Hexo的博客写日常规划和学习笔记好像也没那么好的效果，显得有点杂乱。  
- 以后这里是学习记录的地方，心情和随笔就放在那个小博客里吧。   

Run  
I'll sing it one last time for you    
Then we really have to go    
You've been the only thing that's right   
In all I've done    
And I can barely look at you   
But every single time I do   
I know we'll male it anywhere    
Anywhere from here   
Light up Light up   
As if you have a choice  
Even if you cannot hear my voice  
I'll be right beside you dear  
我将最后为你唱起这首歌，  
然后我们就不得不真的就这样分开。  



Louder Louher  
And we'll run for our lives  
I can hardly speak I understand  
Why you can't raise your voice up  
To think I might not see those eyes  
It makes it so hard not to cry  
And as we say our long goodbye  
I nearly do  


Slower Slower  
We dont't have time for that  
All I want is to find an easier way  
To get out of our little head   
Have heart my dear  
We're bound to be afraid  
Even if it's just for a few days  
Making up for all this mess
